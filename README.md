_Making lunch choices easy for our Flatiron school mates._


When you don't want to decide where to eat, use Lunch Roulette for suggestions. We have created filters catered specifically to bootcampers' needs and preferences. Preferences and ratings for restaurants are exclusively limited to Flatiron students only with @flatiron email domains.

Check out front end code [here](https://github.com/Runnantina/lunch-roulette-client).
